# elm-io-spa

This package combines [orus-io/elm-spa](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/orus-io/elm-spa/latest/)
with [chrilves/elm-io](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/chrilves/elm-io/latest/)
to make creating SPAs as efficient as possible. Please refer to
[examples](https://github.com/uweg/elm-io-spa/tree/main/example) to see how it works.

**Attention:** This is not the most recommended way to create an Elm SPA. Use at your
own risk. However it runs in various production applications without any problems.
